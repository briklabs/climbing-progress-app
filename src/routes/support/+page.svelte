	<div id="faq">
		<h3>Q: How do I track my climbing session?</h3>
		<p>
			A: To track your climbing session, open the app and tap the "Start" button. Follow the
			on-screen instructions to log your progress.
		</p>

		<h3>Q: Can I sync my data across devices?</h3>
		<p>
			A: No, Beta Blitz does not supports data syncing. Your session data never leaves your device
			and gets wiped out on every new session. Nothing outside of your device has access your
			climbing data.
